# TaskManagerApp
A native android application to manage group and personal projects . This is an academic project which was developed while learning mobile cloud computing. 
Google firebase as database and haas been deployed on docker. It was a group project with 5 members. 

My main contribution was designing the App Wireframe on the Sketch first and then Implement that UI on Kotlin and integerate it to the backend.

Yo can see the App UI here: [Taskmanager_UI.pdf](https://github.com/mrangta/TaskManagerApp/blob/master/TaskManager-updatedSketh.pdf)
